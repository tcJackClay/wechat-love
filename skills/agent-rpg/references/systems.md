# RPG Rule Systems

## D20 / 5E (Crunchy)
*   **Resolution**: 1d20 + Ability Mod + Proficiency vs DC.
*   **Combat**: Initiative turns. AC (Armor Class) determines hit. HP (Hit Points) determines life.
*   **Magic**: Vancian (Spell Slots) or Points.
*   **Use when**: Player wants tactical depth and risk of death.

## PbtA / Narrative
*   **Resolution**: 2d6 + Stat.
    *   10+: **Success** (You do it).
    *   7-9: **Mixed Success** (You do it, but there's a cost).
    *   6-: **Failure** (GM makes a hard move).
*   **Combat**: Cinematic. No turns. Damage is abstract (Harm).
*   **Use when**: Player wants drama and story momentum.

## Freeform
*   **Resolution**: GM Fiat. "Does it make sense?"
*   **Combat**: Descriptive. "You swing your sword and decapitate him."
*   **Use when**: Player wants pure roleplay or erp without math.
